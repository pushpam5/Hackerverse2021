## Inspiration
 - This rise in the degree of psychological distress in terms of–Depression, Anxiety and Stress among the adult population in India during the strict lockdown period was much steeper compared to normal which itself is no less dangerous for the masses.

- The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the otherwise masked problems, mainly Depression spreading among masses , sometimes even leading to extreme risk-taking behaviours–including suicidal tendencies.

- It is observed that the main reason behind such disorders was people not sharing their problems and grievances with someone and also keeping themselves chained in negative thoughts leading to stress.

- In such scenarios , one can feel relieved by letting the emotions out through various mediums , and also by spending some time watching or listening to inspirational content and take themselves to a positive space.

- This inspired us to make a platform which has particular features and content which can help people to escape negativity and bring in them the confidence and strength to lower down the psychological distress.






## What the project does

- This Project aims to provide services as content and features for targeted audiences to help them overcome negativity. This would act as their virtual companion.

- The Application would have features which enable users to express themselves, has content that can emotionally stabilize them & motivate them and also they can get personal attention for advice.

- The app has an anonymous posting feature which lets users write down their thoughts, feelings,events in certain words and post it anonymously without fear of being judged.This will help users with a sense of relief.

- The application also contains a variety of exclusive videos available which users can access anytime to get some needed help in boosting morale.

- There is a section of Live sessions too,which will be a sub platform bringing live talk sessions from some exquisite personalities and also the general public sharing their experiences with various issues; users can gain valuable insights about tackling general or specific issues.

- Also, Users can take advantage of the private sessions feature to interact with the experts associated with our platform by paying a nominal fee. They can have their doubts cleared and get insights from professionals. These experts will be available according to schedule and will also be registered with the platform.

- There is also a section for written content , named the 'write-ups' , which contain some insightful articles from authors about various walks of life, depicting the values and making readers visualize things with a different perspective.

- All these features combine to make an integrated platform on which one can spend some time and find themselves far away from psychological distress and gain that little push or motivation to have a positive attitude towards things.This will certainly help in bringing down the number of individuals who somewhat feel lost their way and feel depressed.


- First of all, the user needs to register themselves with application by just providing his/her Email ID .This would ensure the anonymity of the user and they can feel free to access this platform.Then user will be asked to choose a password which will be asked later for authentication during Logging In to the app.A verification link will be sent to the Email-ID provided to complete the registration process.

	

- Now User can Log In to his account using email-id & password.

- While visiting the app for the first time, users will see the app tour which will provide a basic overview of the application.



 


- After this, the user will be directed to the Homepage.

- Homepage has BottomTabBar which contains different services, clicking each of these will navigate the user to a different page where the services/features can be used.



- Users will have the permission to change the appearance of the application to an extent, to make it feel like their own space. They can keep track of upcoming live sessions and get notifications reminding them about the same.
